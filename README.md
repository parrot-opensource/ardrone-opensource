>**Intro**
Parrot, likely because of Parrot all it's heavy company changes,
is at the moment AFAIK not adhering to GNU and give access of used sources in Ardrone and Ardrone2.

They are legally bount to it, but probbably are to busy reorganizing.

As an interim solution some of used sources can be found in this repository.

Possibly we added to little or to much of the " <- missing" sources.

If you have the full sources, it would be fantastic if you add it to this
repository. Feel free to correct and add what you have and make a pull request.

e.g. for the Linux kernel sadly we lack the Parrot created "linux.config"

Open Source Software used in **Parrot Ardrone2**.

Unless stated otherwise, later versions of the firmware
use these same software modules.

>**Note** : this is **NOT** the Software Development Kit (SDK).
