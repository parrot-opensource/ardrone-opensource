config SERIAL_PARROT5
	bool "Parrot5/5+ serial port support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_PARROT
	select SERIAL_CORE
	help
	  If you have a board based on Parrot5/5+ SoC you
	  can enable its onboard serial port by enabling this option.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
          module will be called parrot5-serial.

config SERIAL_PARROT5_CONSOLE
	bool "Console on Parrot5/5+ serial port"
	depends on SERIAL_PARROT5
	select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	help
	  Select this option if you want to use one of the Parrot5/5+ serial ports
	  as console.

config SERIAL_DCC
	bool "JTAG ICE/ICD DCC serial port emulation support"
	depends on ARM
	select SERIAL_CORE
	help
	  This selects serial port emulation driver for ICE/ICD JTAG debugger
	  (e.g. Trace32) for ARM architecture. You should make an terminal with
	  DCC(JTAG1) protocol.

	  if unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_DCC_IDLE_POLL
	bool "Poll dcc io"
	depends on SERIAL_DCC
	help
		Improve dcc speed on cpu with dcc irq

config SERIAL_DCC_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on JTAG ICE/ICD DCC"
	depends on SERIAL_DCC
	select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say Y here if you wish to use ICE/ICD JTAG DCC serial port emulation
	  as the system console.

	  if unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_DCC_STDSERIAL
	bool "Install JTAG ICE/ICD DCC as standard serial"
	default y
	depends on !SERIAL_8250 && SERIAL_DCC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to install DCC driver as a normal serial port
	  /dev/ttyS0 (major 4, minor 64). Otherwise, it appears as /dev/ttyJ0
	  (major 204, minor 186) and can co-exist with other UARTs, such as
	  8250/16C550 compatibles.
