The camera driver use v4l2 API http://v4l2spec.bytesex.org/spec-single/v4l2.html.

The application should configure the camera with i2c before starting video
capture.

*** number of irq per line ***

this can be configured with the module param lines_per_irq (generate an it each 2^lines_per_irq lines (range 0-7 default 7)
Like other module params, you can select it on :
- kernel command line "p6_camif.lines_per_irq"
- insmod option "lines_per_irq"
- sysfs "/sys/module/p6_camif/parameters/lines_per_irq


*** special ioctl for partial frame ***

#define PARTIAL_IOCTL _IOWR('V', BASE_VIDIOC_PRIVATE, struct v4l2_buffer)
struct v4l2_buffer buf;
ioctl (fd, PARTIAL_IOCTL, &buf);

buf.index indicate the current buffer
buf.length indicate the offset of the image that is capurated (in Y offset).
The end of frame is indicated by buf.length == frame_size or buf.index changing.
buf.index changing shouldn't happen if normal case.

This ioctl is blocking until the next blockline irq.
It is to the application to use a select on v4l2 desciptor before calling this ioctl to check if a full frame is not ready.

See example in packages/utils/camera.
